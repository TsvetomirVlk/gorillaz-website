    <div id="doubleD" class="col charChar"><div class="text-center"><h2>D2</h2></div>  <div class="container ">Hit twice on the head when young, 2D is a sweetheart with a blank sheet of paper where a brain should be. He has really good hair. People think he's cool and enigmatic but he's just got a migraine. 2D idolises Murdoc, who, he feels, saved his life. Keyboard wizard, melodica maniac, graffiti compulsive and the perfect pin-up product. Voice like an angel, arse like a satsuma. Mind full of zombies and painkillers. Says nothing controversial. Says nothing much at all. Loved by everyone (except the green eyed Murdoc), 2D has legions of lady followers and would make a good boyfriend if only he'd wake up.<div class = "murdocInfo"> <h3>Age: 36</h3> <h3>Vocals and guitar</h3></div></div></div>

      <div  class="col charChar"> <div class="text-center"><h2>Noodle</h2></div> <div class="container "> Noodle arrived in a crate. She's a kick riffmeister, the Asian axe princess. She doesn't speak more than a word of English, and that word is "Noodle." Martial Arts expert, little ice maiden, she looks at the world through unphased eyes. Usually found with Russel. Special zen bond with 2-D. Tickled by Murdoc's desperation. Irrepressible. Inscrutable. Irresistable. Likes: Power Puff Girls, Tomagatchi pets, Pokemon, Yo-yo's, her new radio headphone hat, rice and noodles.<div class = "murdocInfo"> <h3>Age: 27</h3> <h3>Primary guitar</h3></div> </div></div>

        <div id="murdoc" class="col charChar"> <div class="text-center"><h2>Murdoc</h2></div> <div class="container ">Murdoc Alphonce[1] Niccals was born in Stoke-On-Trent on June 6th, 1966. Although the exact whereabouts were never verified, it was rumoured that his mother gave to birth him at the Belphegor Sanatorium, a halfway house for "the sick, the needy and the incredibly bored."

As an infant, he was dumped on the doorstep of his father's house one night and was discovered by him as he was returning home from the pub.

Murdoc went on to a very abusive childhood. It has been proposed that his many addictions and his sour attitude were due to his abusive childhood. His father, Sebastian Jacob Niccals, (or Jacob Sebastian Niccals, depending on who's asking) was a spiteful drunk of a man who often verbally abused and exploited his sons. <div class = "murdocInfo"> <h3>Age: 52</h3> <h3>Bass "El Diablo"</h3></div> </div></div>
